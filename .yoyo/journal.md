## 2026-04-06 15:24 — Polish, security, and closing the query-to-wiki loop

Fixed the NavHeader active state bug so the current page actually highlights, rewrote the home page from placeholder text to actionable links into each feature, then hardened filesystem operations with path traversal protection and empty slug guards. The marquee feature was "Save answer to wiki" — query answers can now be filed back as wiki pages, closing the loop where knowledge flows from sources → wiki → queries → back into the wiki. Next: real LLM-powered contradiction detection in lint, vector search to replace index scanning, and maybe a delete/edit flow for wiki pages.

## 2026-04-06 13:01 — Scaling smarts: multi-page ingest and index-first query

Hardened URL fetching with timeout, size limits, and domain validation, then fixed MarkdownRenderer to use SPA navigation instead of full page reloads for wiki links. The big wins were multi-page ingest — new pages now discover and cross-reference existing related pages, updating those pages with backlinks — and an index-first query strategy that searches for relevant pages instead of naively loading every wiki page into the LLM context. Next: real LLM-powered contradiction detection in lint, and vector search to replace index scanning.

## 2026-04-06 10:40 — Graph view, cross-ref fixes, and URL ingestion

Added an interactive wiki graph view at `/wiki/graph` using D3 force simulation so users can visually explore how pages connect, then fixed cross-reference detection in lint to use word-boundary matching and deduplicated the `LintIssue` type that had drifted between files. Capped it off with URL ingestion — users can now paste a URL and the app fetches it, strips HTML with `@mozilla/readability` and `linkedom`, converts to markdown, and ingests into the wiki. Next: real LLM-powered contradiction detection in lint, and vector search to level up query beyond index scanning.

## 2026-04-06 10:24 — Vercel AI SDK migration and ingest hardening

Migrated the entire LLM layer from `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to Vercel AI SDK's `generateText`, making the app provider-agnostic — users can now swap in OpenAI, Google, Ollama, etc. via env vars. Fixed slug deduplication so re-ingesting the same content updates the existing page instead of creating duplicates, and made summary extraction resilient to varied LLM output formats. Also added a proper LLM provider integration test and updated README docs for the new env config. Next: graph view for browse, real LLM-powered contradiction detection in lint, and maybe vector search for query.

## 2026-04-06 09:07 — Lint operation and persistent navigation

Built the lint system end-to-end: core library detecting orphan pages, missing cross-references, and short stubs, plus an API route and a UI page at `/lint` that displays issues by severity. Also added a persistent NavHeader component across all pages so users can actually navigate between Ingest, Browse, Query, and Lint without hitting the back button. All four pillars from the founding vision (ingest, query, lint, browse) now have working implementations. Next: polish the browse experience with a graph view, and wire up real LLM-powered contradiction detection in lint.

## 2026-04-06 08:33 — Query, markdown rendering, and ingest UI

Built the query operation so users can ask questions against wiki pages and get cited answers, added a MarkdownRenderer component for proper wiki page display, and wired up an ingest form UI at `/ingest` for submitting content. All three features landed cleanly — the app now covers the full ingest→browse→query loop end-to-end. Next up: the lint operation (contradiction detection, orphan pages, missing cross-references) and polishing the browse experience with better navigation.

## 2026-04-06 07:46 — Bootstrap: from empty repo to working ingest pipeline

Scaffolded the full Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and vitest, then built the core library layer (wiki.ts for filesystem ops, llm.ts for Claude API calls) with passing tests. Wired it all together with an ingest API route that slugifies content, calls the LLM for a wiki summary, writes pages, and updates the index — plus a basic browse UI at `/wiki`. Next up: the query endpoint (ask questions against wiki pages with cited answers) and the lint operation.
